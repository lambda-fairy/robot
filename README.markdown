The Haskell Robot
=================

**Robot** is a library for sending fake keyboard and mouse events using
[Haskell][]. Applications will respond as though the user performed the
actions themselves.

[Haskell]: http://haskell.org/

Only X11 systems are supported right now, but Windows and Mac can be
added later if anyone cares.

Here are some things you can do:

* Test graphical interfaces and websites!

* Play silly pranks on your friends!

* Finally beat those [silly Flash games where you press the same button
  over and over again really fast][blah blah blah]. I don't like those.
